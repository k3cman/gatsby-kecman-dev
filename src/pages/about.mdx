Hi, there! I'm Front-end developer, working full time on Angular applications, and exploring world of programming and javascript in my free time.

I've always had a passion for creating small things, around the house, but when I discovered Photoshop, and ability to start from blank canvas and create something awesome. For many
years before going into programming, I developed small Wordpress sites for local businesses and did small graphic design jobs.

Having worn many hats in my career between business developement, marketing management, 3D vizuelization, graphic design, 
I use my experience to be more than just a coder, and I'm trying to at the same time think as UX designer, 
marketing specialist with customers needs and habits on mind.
